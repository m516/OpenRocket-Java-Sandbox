# OpenRocket-Java-Sandbox
This is a simple Eclipse project that uses the exposed classes in the OpenRocket executable JAR file to run and change simulations. 

## Setup
These instructions assume you have Java 1.8 installed on your computer and is the default JRE and JDK. If that's not the case, please do so before continuing. Otherwise Eclipse won't start properly (without Java) or OpenRocket will likely throw errors (with Java 9+: [See ](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues/542)[these ](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues/433)[issues](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues/347) from the [OpenRocket repository](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/))

Download the latest version of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). You will need a Java JVM

## Creating new projects with OpenRocket and Eclipse
1. Create a new Eclipse Java project.
2. Download [OpenRocket](http://openrocket.info/). It sould be a single `.jar` file. Place it in the project folder.
3. Import OpenRocket as a library. More on that [here](https://github.com/m516/SnakeApp/wiki/Your-First-Snake)
4. Code away!
