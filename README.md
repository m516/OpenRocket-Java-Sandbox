# OpenRocket-Java-Sandbox
This is a simple Eclipse project that uses the exposed classes in the OpenRocket executable JAR file to run and change simulations. 

## Setup
These instructions assume you have Java 1.8 installed on your computer and is the default JRE and JDK. If that's not the case, please do so before continuing. Otherwise Eclipse won't start properly (without Java) or OpenRocket will likely throw errors (with Java 9+: [See ](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues/542)[these ](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues/433)[issues](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues/347) from the [OpenRocket repository](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/))

1) Download the latest version of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). Then open it.

2) Clone this repository and place it into any folder/drive of your choice.

3) In the main menu (usually on top of the screen), navigate to `File` -> `Open Projects from File System`. Choose the root folder of the local copy of this Git repository.

4) Code away!
